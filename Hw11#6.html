<h1>Talledega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby Review</h1>
<p>10/10 Great Movie. This is my favorite Will Farrell Movie and I don't think that <br> will ever change.  This is my favorite comedy of all time.  My favorite scene would <br> probably be the last race that they have, where Ricky Bobby and Jean Gerrard race the last stretch on foot.  </p>
